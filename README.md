                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Digital Signal and Image Processing (CSC703) and Digital Signal and Image Processing Lab (CSL703) are core subjects in the Final Year (Semester VII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of signal processing techniques, image enhancement, restoration, compression, and segmentation algorithms.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in DSIP:

- **Discrete Time Signals & Systems**: Classification of signals and systems, convolution, correlation.
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Properties of DFT, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms (DIT and DIF).
- **Image Enhancement**: Point processing, histogram processing, spatial filtering.
- **Image Segmentation**: Detection of discontinuities, edge linking, thresholding, region-based segmentation.
- **Image Compression**: Redundancy, compression standards (JPEG, MPEG).
- **Morphological Image Processing**: Erosion, dilation, opening, closing.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding signal and image processing principles is crucial for building robust systems in computer vision and multimedia. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through DSIP.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
